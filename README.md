# upgraded-todo

### Goal
Create a "todo" application using:
- NodeJS/MongoDB to store date
- Angular2 for the desktop application (using Material design)
- Ionic2 for mobile apps (ios+android) - But maybe responsive is sufficient (Progressive webapp in the future?)

### Requirements
- Ability to have categories and sub-categories. Best would be no limit, but depth of 3/4 should be sufficient
  - work => project => tasks
  - home => travels => destination => tasks
  - personal => projects => todolist => gui => tasks
- Ability to share categories with others. At any level (Could be Home, or only one Destination)
- Tasks can have an "In Progress" state. Not only "done". 
- Tasks can have a picture and a description. For example, "Change the Fridge's filter can show a picture of the filter and instructions on how to do it". 
- Tasks can be timed. Useful for work tasks and reporting. Time can also be entered manually. 
- Reports on categories (Total time spent, etc..)
